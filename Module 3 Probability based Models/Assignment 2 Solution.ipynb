While the precision for predicting high charges is perfect, meaning that all of the charges predicted as high charges actually are high charges, a substantial number of low charges were misclassified as high (poor recall).  This means that many of the insurance applicaitons would be rated higher than their actual risk."

    "The model seems to be even less accurate (compared to Naive Bayes) when working with the testing data versus the training data. However the balance between precision and recall is pretty good. Predicting high charges is still a bit more challenging that predicting low charge, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "The log odds coefficients for sex and smoker are negative. Since smoker = yes is coded as 0, this means that smokers tend to have higher charges and he movement from smoker to non-smoker (0 to 1) shows a negative effect. The same is true for sex, where a move from females to males has a negative effect on charges. The rest of the coefficients are positive, indicateing a positive relationship between the variable and charges.  Note that since the southwest region is the reference case, all other regions experience higher charges than the southwest region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the odds ratio conversion of the coefficients, which is easier to interpret, we see that the value of the coefficient indicates the incresaing (or decreasing) probability of being classified as high charges with a one unit change in the predictor value, holding all other predictors constant. For example, the odds ratio coefficient of age is 1.14, indicating that for each additional year in age, the odds of being classified as high charges increases by 1.14 times. Note that sex and smoker are now positive in the odds ratio interpretation (they were negative for log odds), however the values are less than one, meaning that there is a decreasing marginal effect."

    "It appears that logistic regression is handling this data better than naive bayes. The accuracy and precision/recall balance is better than the Bayesian approach.  Even though there is slightly greater imbalance between training and testing for logistic regression, the testing accuracy for logistic regression is better that for Naive Bayes, so I would say that logistic regression is better for this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we may also want to ask ourselves why this is the case? Why is Naive Bayes performing poorly by comparison? At least part of the problem is the fact that the assumptopn of a normal distribution is not supported for this current data set.  Baysian models are very sensitive to the underlying data distribution.  The further it strays from a standard normal distribution, the stranger the results tend to become."
